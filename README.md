# Meme-Generator

I developed a Meme Generator app using ReactJS that allows users to create and share customized memes. The app seamlessly integrates with external APIs, enabling users to access a vast library of images for meme creation. Leveraging React's component-based architecture, I implemented dynamic image manipulation functionalities, such as text overlay and resizing, to provide users with flexible meme customization options. Additionally, I focused on delivering a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in ReactJS but also showcases my skills in API integration, UI/UX design, and delivering an interactive and engaging user experience.
